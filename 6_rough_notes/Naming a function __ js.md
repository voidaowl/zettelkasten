# Naming conventions
Functions are actions. So their name is usually a *verb*. It should be brief, accurate, descriptive.

Itâ€™s a widespread practice to start a function with a verbal prefix which vaguely describes the action. For example:
- `'get...'` â€“ return a value,
- `'calc...'` â€“ calculate something,
- `'create...'` â€“ create something,
- `'check...'` â€“ check something.

Use camelCase.

# âœ… â†’ Best practices
> [!info] **One function â€“ one action**
> A function should do exactly what it suggests by its name, and no more.
> 
> Two independent actions usually deserve two functions, even if they are usually called together (in that case, make a 3rd function that calls the other two).

A few examples of breaking this rule:
- `getAge` â€“ would be bad if it shows an `alert` with the age (should only get).
- `createForm` â€“ would be bad if it modifies the document, adding a form to it (should only create and return).
- `checkPermissions` â€“ would be bad if it displays the `access granted/denied` message (should only perform the check and return the result).

> [!info] **Ultrashort function names**
> Functions that are used *very often* usually have ultrashort names.
> These are exceptions. Generally, function names should be concise and descriptive.
