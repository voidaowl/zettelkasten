# Introduction
Write introduction.

# Conventions
Follow these conventions at all times.

## Tagging
Use formal tags (internal links) to bind notes to the root file. Their number may vary according to need.
Ensure that stepping into a tag will eventually lead to the `root` file in no more than than four steps. This is meant to prevent confusion and facilitate a ‘train-of-thought’ system, facilitating memorization.
Use informal tags (`#`) to indicate status and activity.

## Naming
Name indices and categories in lowercase, with words separated by underscores.
Name tags and notes in sentence case or title case, as needed, without underscores.
