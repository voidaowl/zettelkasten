# Introduction
Write introduction.

# Conventions
Follow these conventions at all times.

## Tagging
Use formal tags (internal links) to bind notes to the root file. Their number may vary according to need.
Ensure that stepping into a tag will eventually lead to the `root` file in no more than than four steps. This is meant to prevent confusion and facilitate a ‘train-of-thought’ system, facilitating memorization.
Use informal tags (`#`) to indicate status and activity.

## Naming
Name indices and categories in lowercase, with words separated by underscores.
Name tags and notes in sentence case or title case, as needed, without underscores. Sometimes, for clarification, we can add a pair of underscores and an acronym at the end to clarify (e.g. `Hello, world! __ js` is a note about how to write the `Hello, world!` message in the JavaScript programming language).
