# The “Sources” panel
With some variation between browser, you may find the `Sources` panel in the Developer Tools.

The Sources panel has 3 parts:
1. The **File Navigator** pane lists HTML, JavaScript, CSS and other files, including images that are attached to the page. Chrome extensions may appear here too.
2. The **Code Editor** pane shows the source code.
3. The **JavaScript Debugging** pane is for debugging, we’ll explore it soon.
