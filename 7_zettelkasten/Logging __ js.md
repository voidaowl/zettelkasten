# Logging
To output something to console from our code, there’s the `console.log` function.
```JavaScript title:example.js
// open console to see
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	console.log("value,", i);
}
```

Regular users don’t see that output. It’s in the console. To see it, open the browser’s Console panel of developer tools.

If we have enough logging in our code, then we can see what’s going on from the records, without the debugger.
