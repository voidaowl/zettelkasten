# Types of prosody

Classical languages → *quantitative* prosody → vowel length or quantity.

In Anglo-Saxon (i.e. Old English), prosody was *qualitative*, based on patterns of stress or accent (and other rules, re: alliteration).

Anglo-Saxon → *qualitative* prosody → patterns of stress or accent.

Slavic languages (e.g. Russian) → *synthetic* language → meaning added with prefixes and infecting endings, one stress per word, etc.

Romance languages → *syllabic* prosody → number of syllables in each line.

Modern English → *analytical* language:
- distributes meaning among many words,
- grammar dependent on prepositions and word-order instead of inflected endings.

*Skeltonics* → re: John Skelton (?1460-1529, xEng) → “tumbling prosody”.

Main post-medieval system of prosody in English → *accentual-syllabic*:
- qualitative,
- disregards syllable length,
- *us/stressed beats*
- syllables on which emphatic accent is (not) placed.
