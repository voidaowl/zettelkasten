# Iterables and array-likes
Two official terms look similar, but are very different:
1. **Iterables** are objects that implement the `Symbol.iterato` method.
2. **Array-likes** are objects that have indexes and `length`, so they look like arrays.

Strings are both iterable and array-like.

Both iterables and array-likes are usually **not arrays**, as they donâ€™t have `push`, `pop`, etc.
