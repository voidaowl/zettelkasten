# Other tools
In the informational dropdowns to the right, there are more tools that allow us to examine the current code state:
1. `Watch` – **shows current values for any expressions**.
	You can click the plus `+` and input an expression. The debugger will show its value, automatically recalculating it in the process of execution.
2. `Call Stack` – **shows the nested calls chain.**
	If you click on a stack item (e.g. “anonymous”), the debugger jumps to the corresponding code, and all its variables can be examined as well.
3. `Scope` – **current variables.**
	`Local` shows local function variables. You can also see their values highlighted right over the source.
	`Global` has global variables (out of any functions).
	There’s also `this` keyword there that we didn’t study yet, but we’ll do that soon.
