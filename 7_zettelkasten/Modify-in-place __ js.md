We sometimes need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in the same variable. For example:
```JavaScript title:example.js
let n = 2;
n = n + 5;
n = n * 2;
```

This notation can be shortened by the operators `+=` and `-=`:
```JavaScript title:example.js
let n = 2;
n += 5; // now n = 7
n *= 2; // now n = 14
```

Short ‚Äúmodify-and-assign‚Äù operators exit for all arithmetic and bitwise operators: `/=`, `-=`, etc.

Such operators have the same precedence as a normal assignment, so they run after most other calculations.
```JavaScript title:example.js
let n = 2;

n *= 3 + 5;

alert( n ); // 16
```
