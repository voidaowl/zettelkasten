# Identify counting numbers and whole numbers

The most basic numbers used in algebra are those we use to count objects: $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...$ and so on. These are called *counting numbers*. The notation “$...$” is called an *ellipsis*. Counting numbers are also called **natural numbers**.

> [!Note] **COUNTING NUMBERS**
> The counting numbers start with 1 and continue…
> $$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...$$


Natural numbers and whole numbers can be visualized on a **number line**:

> **Fig. 1.2.** The numbers on the number line increase from left to right, and decrease from right to left.

The point labeled $0$ is called the **origin**. The points are equally spaced to the right of 0 and labeled with the natural numbers. When a number is paired with a point, it is called the **coordinate** of the point.

Including $0$ with the natural numbers gives the set of **whole numbers**.

> The whole numbers are counting numbers and zero.
> $$0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...$$
