# Computed properties

We can use square brackets in an object literal, when creating an object. Thatâ€™s called *computed properties*.
```JavaScript title:example.js
let fruit = prompt("What fruit to buy?", "apple");

let bag = {
	[fruit]: 5,
};

alert( bag.apple ); // 5 if fruit="apple"
```

The meaning of a computed property is simple: `[fruit]` means that the property name should be taken from `fruit`.

We can use more complex expressions inside square brackets:
```JavaScript title:example.js
let fruit = 'apple';
let bag = {
	[fruit + 'Computers']: 5 // bag.appleComputers = 5
};
```
