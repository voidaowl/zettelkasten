# Bitwise operators
Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary representation.

These operators arenâ€™t JS-specific. Theyâ€™re supported in most programming languages.

The list of operators:
1. AND `&`
2. OR `|`
3. XOR `^`
4. NOT `~`
5. LEFT SHIFT `<<`
6. RIGHT SHIFT `>>`
7. ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT `>>>`

These operators are seldom used, when we need to fiddle with numbers on the bitwise level. Web development has little use of them, except in cryptography.
