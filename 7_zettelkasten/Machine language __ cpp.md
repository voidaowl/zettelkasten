# Machine language

CPUs are only capable of processing instructions written in **machine language** (or **machine code**).

The set of all possible machine language instructions that a given CPU can understand is called an **instruction set**.

Example: `10110000 01100001`.

Each instruction is composed of a sequence of `1`s and `0`, which are called **binary digits**, or **bits**. The number of bits in a machine language varies (up to 32 bits long, or more in the x86 CPU family).

Each family of compatible CPUs (e.g. x86, Arm64) has its own machine language, incompatible with the MLs of other CPUs.
