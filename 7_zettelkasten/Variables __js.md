```JavaScript title:example.js
// Declaration
let name;
// Assignment
name = "John";
// Declaration and assignment
let message = "Hello";

// Multiple variable assignments
let user = 'Jim',
	age = 25,
	message = 'Hello';

// Comma-first style
let user = 'Erika'
	, age = 22
	, message = 'Hi';
```

# 🔍 → What does it do?
A **variable** is “named storage” for data.

# ❓ → How it does it.
Variables are binding between **names** and **values**. An assignment binds a name to a new value. Multiple names can be bound to the same value.
