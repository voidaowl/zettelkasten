# Assembly Languages

In an **assembly language** (often called **assembly** for short), each instruction is identified by a short abbreviation (rather than a set of bits), and names and other numbers can be used.

Since CPUs can only speak machine language, assembly programs must be translated into machine language before they can be executed by the computer. This is done by using a program called an **assembler**, which takes assembly source code as input, and outputs a program containing machine language instructions.

Just as each CPU has its own machine language, each CPU family also has its own assembly language, which is designed to be assembled into machine language for the same CPU family.
