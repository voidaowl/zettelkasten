# Introduction to programs and programming languages

A **computer program** is a sequence of instructions that directs a computer to perform certain actions in a specific order.

A **programming language** is a language designed to facilitate the writing of instructions for computers.

The act of writing a program is called **programming**.

When a computer is performing actions described by the instructions in a computer program, we say it’s **running** or **executing** the program.

A computer won’t begin the execution of a program until told to do so, which require the user to **launch / run / execute** the program. Programs may be launched by other programs.

Programs are executed on the computer’s **hardware**, which consists of the physical components which make up a computer.

**Software** broadly refers to the programs on a system that are designed to be executed on hardware.

A **platform** refers to a compatible set of hardware and software (OS, browser, etc.) that provides an environment for software to run.

A program that can be easily transferred from a platform to another is said to be **portable**.

The act of modifying a program so that it runs on a different platform is called **porting**.
