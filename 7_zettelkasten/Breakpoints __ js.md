# Breakpoints
A *breakpoint* isa point of code where the debugger will automatically pause the JavaScript execution.

While the code is paused, we can examine current variables, execute commands in the console etc. In other words, we can debug it.

We can always find a list of breakpoints in the right panel. That’s useful when we have many breakpoints in various files. It allows us to:
- Quickly jump to the breakpoint in the code (by clicking on the right panel).
- Temporarily disable the breakpoint by unchecking it.
- Remove the breakpoint by right-clicking and selecting Remove.
- …and so on.

> [!info] **Conditional breakpoints**
> *Right click* on the line number allows to create a *conditional* breakpoint. It only triggers when the given expression, that you should provide when you create it, is truthy.
> 
> That’s handy when we need to stop only for a certain variable value or for certain function parameters.
