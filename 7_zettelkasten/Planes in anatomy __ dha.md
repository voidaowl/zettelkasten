# Planes
Anatomical descriptions are based on four imaginary planes – median, sagittal, coronal and horizontal – applied to a body in the anatomical position.

The **median** plane passes longitudinally through the body and divides it into **right** and **left** halves.

The **sagittal** plane is any vertical plane parallel with the median plane; although often employed, ‘parasagittal’  is therefore redundant and should not be used.

The **coronal** (frontal) plane is orthogonal to the median plane and divides the body into **anterior** (front) and **posterior** (back).

The **horizontal** (transverse) plane is orthogonal to both median and sagittal planes. Radiologist refer to transverse planes as (trans)axial planes. Convention dictates that axial anatomy is viewed as though looking from the feet towards the head.
