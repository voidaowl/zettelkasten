# Operator precedence
If an expression has more than one operator, the execution order is defined by their *precedence*, or, in other words, the default priority order of operators. Parentheses override any precedence.

| Precedence | Name           | Sign |
| ---------- | -------------- | ---- |
| â€¦          | â€¦              | â€¦    |
| 14         | unary plus     | `+`  |
| 14         | unary negation | `-`  |
| 13         | exponentiation | `**` |
| 12         | multiplication | `*`  |
| 12         | division       | `/`  |
| 11         | addition       | `+`  |
| 11         | subtraction    | `-`  |
| â€¦          | â€¦              | â€¦    |
| 2          | assignment     | `=`  |
| â€¦          | â€¦              | â€¦    |
